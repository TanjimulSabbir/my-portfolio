                    Hey there, I'm Tanjimul Islam Sabbir, a front-end developer with a love for turning code into amazing web experiences. In the vibrant year of 2021, a transformative chapter began as I stepped into the halls of Rajshahi University, setting the stage for an extraordinary odyssey. I got my first own computer and soon found myself falling in love with coding. Python was my first language, and it opened the door to a world of my programmimg.

                    <strong className='text-green-500'> As time passed,</strong>  I got into web technologies â€“ things like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. But it was when I discovered tools like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and JavaScript that my real passion ignited. React.js became my playground, and Redux and GraphQL joined the mix for smoother operations.

                <p>
                    <strong className='text-green-500'> While I've explored backend technologies like Node.js,</strong>
                    Express.js, and MongoDB, my heart truly belongs to the front end. I thrive on solving intricate problems and creating interactive user experiences. Design is cool, but I find my joy in making things work seamlessly. <br />
                    I recently had an opportunity to work with a great company in India. Although I had to step back due to my university's class and exam, the experience taught me a lot and fueled my commitment to learning and growth. Collaboration is key for me. I believe in the power of teamwork, where every voice matters.

                    <strong className='text-green-500'>Outside of coding,</strong>

                    I enjoy nature photograpy and music, which adds a dash of inspiration to my work.
                    MY Favourite Colour is Skyblue.
                    Gardening is
                    my hobby. I have an indoor
                    garden. I love nature. In my leisure period, I collect various kinds of Nature Photos. My favourite
                    flower is
                    Water-hyacinths. It is a polyphyletic genus of the aquatic flowering plants.
