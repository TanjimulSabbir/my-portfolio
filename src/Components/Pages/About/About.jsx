                            I'm Tanjimul Islam Sabbir. I'm a front-end developer with a love for turning code into amazing web experiences. In the vibrant year of 2021, a transformative chapter began when I start studying in Rajshahi University, setting the stage for an extraordinary odyssey. I got my first own computer and soon found myself falling in love with coding. Python was my first language, and it opened the door to a world of my programmimg.

                            <strong className='text-custom-highLightTextColor'> As time passed, </strong>  I got into web technologies â€“ things like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. But it was when I discovered tools like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and JavaScript that my real passion ignited. React.js became my playground, and Redux and GraphQL joined the mix for smoother operations.

                            Express.js, and MongoDB, my heart truly belongs to the front end. I thrive on solving intricate problems and creating interactive user experiences. Design is cool, but I find my joy in making things work seamlessly.

                            to work with a great company in India. Although I had to step back after 2 months due to my university's class and exam, the experience taught me a lot and fueled my commitment to learning and growth. Collaboration is key for me. I believe in the power of teamwork, where every voice matters.
