              <strong className="text-custom-highlight">üöÄ What I Do:</strong>{" "}
              With solid expertise in React.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and
              Tailwind CSS, I build responsive and dynamic web applications that
              solve real-world problems. I have hands-on experience developing
              complex features such as real-time communication (video/audio
              calling, chat), multi-language support, and seamless form
              validation using React Hook Form and Zod. My journey started with
              mastering core web technologies ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî and
              evolved to include cutting-edge libraries and tools like ShadCN,
              Ant Design, RTK Query, and Material UI.

            <p>
              <strong> üíº Professional Experience:</strong> I‚Äôve contributed to
              diverse projects ‚Äî from e-commerce platforms and travel booking
              systems to social media apps ‚Äî collaborating closely with backend
              teams to integrate APIs and optimize user interactions. Whether
              leading feature development or enhancing UI/UX design, I thrive on
              delivering clean, maintainable code and scalable front-end
              architectures

              I‚Äôm deeply curious about philosophy, existentialism, theology, and
              history‚Äîtopics that inspire me to think about human life,
              civilization, and our place in the world. I believe that exploring
              these ideas enriches my creativity and problem-solving mindset,
              helping me approach challenges with a thoughtful and open
              perspective. work.

              When I‚Äôm not working or reading, I enjoy tending my indoor garden,
