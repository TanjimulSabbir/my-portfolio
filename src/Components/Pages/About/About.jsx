                            I'm Tanjimul Islam Sabbir. I'm a front-end developer with a love for turning code into amazing web experiences. In the vibrant year of 2021, a transformative chapter began. Now, I'm studying in Rajshahi University. I got my first own computer at university and soon found myself falling in love with coding. Python was my first language, and it opened the door to a world of my programmimg.

                            <strong className=''> As time passed, </strong>  I got into web technologies â€“ things like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. But it was when I discovered tools like TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that my real passion ignited. My playground is now React.js, with Redux added for more seamless operations.

                            <strong className=""> While I've explored backend technologies like </strong> Node.js,
                            Express.js, and MongoDB, I feel truly belongs to the backend. I thrive on solving intricate problems and creating interactive user experiences.I like design, but I really enjoy smoothly solving tricky problems. I more prefer to work with complex UI logic than others. Most of my working time, I personally focus on write more readable, concise and clean code. Most of my time of coding pass on solving logic. I also love problem solving.

                            to work with a great company in India. Although I had to step back after 2 months due to my university's class and exam, the experience taught me a lot and fueled my commitment to learning and growth. Collaboration is a things that helps achieve something super fast. I believe in the power of teamwork, where every talk matters.

                            Gardening is my hobby. I have an indoor garden.
                            I enjoy nature photograpy and music, which adds a dash of inspiration to my work.
