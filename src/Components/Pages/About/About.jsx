                            I'm Tanjimul Islam Sabbir, a front-end developer with a love for turning code into amazing web experiences. In the vibrant year of 2021, a transformative chapter began as I stepped into the halls of Rajshahi University, setting the stage for an extraordinary odyssey. I got my first own computer and soon found myself falling in love with coding. Python was my first language, and it opened the door to a world of my programmimg.

                            <strong className='text-custom-highLightTextColor'> As time passed, </strong>  I got into web technologies â€“ things like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. But it was when I discovered tools like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and JavaScript that my real passion ignited. React.js became my playground, and Redux and GraphQL joined the mix for smoother operations.

                            <strong className="text-custom-highLightTextColor"> While I've explored backend technologies like Node.js, </strong>
                            Express.js, and MongoDB, my heart truly belongs to the front end. I thrive on solving intricate problems and creating interactive user experiences. Design is cool, but I find my joy in making things work seamlessly. <br />
                            <strong className='text-custom-highLightTextColor'>I recently had an opportunity, </strong>
                            to work with a great company in India. Although I had to step back due to my university's class and exam, the experience taught me a lot and fueled my commitment to learning and growth. Collaboration is key for me. I believe in the power of teamwork, where every voice matters.
